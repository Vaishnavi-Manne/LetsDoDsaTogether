# Tailwind CSS Styling Issue

## Problem
Tailwind CSS styles were not visible in your project because the required Tailwind directives were missing from `src/index.css`. Only `@tailwind base;` was present, but `@tailwind components;` and `@tailwind utilities;` are also needed for Tailwind to work properly.

## Solution
The following lines were added to `src/index.css`:

```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

This ensures all Tailwind CSS features are available in your project.

## Next Steps
- Make sure you are using Tailwind utility classes in your components.
- Restart your dev server if styles do not appear immediately.

## Reference
See the [Tailwind CSS Installation Guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for more details.
